Task #7

Calculate double integral

I = S (A x ^ 2 + B y ^ 2 + C) dx dy over the region x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 <= 1, A > 0, B > 0, C > 0,

using 2 Monte Carlo methods. First method is based on mean value theorem.
The second one uses the representation of the double integral as the volume of a vertical cylinder bounded from above by the surface

z = f(x, y) = A x ^ 2 + B y ^ 2 + C.

Compare results.
