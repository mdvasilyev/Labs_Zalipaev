Task #5

Find dielectric permittivity of layer using electromagnetic plane wave scattering data.
Electromagnetic parameters are ε = ε_1 + ie_2, μ = 1. 


Let a plane electromagnetic wave propagate through a horizontal homogeneous dielectric layer from a dispersing medium with electrodynamic parameters along the z axis from bottom to top. Let the electric component of the field be directed along the y axis. It is assumed that there is a vacuum above and below the layer. Let the time signal E_tr(t, z) of the transmitted wave at the observation point with the coordinate z>0 be given. Solve the inverse problem of defining a function. To do this, use the Newton iterative sequence to restore the refractive index function n, and hence, that is, solve the inverse problem of restoring the parameters of the dielectric layer.
