Task #8

Solve initial value problem for first order ODE.

Examine numerical solutions of initial value problem for the first order ODE using fourth oderder Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods.

Examine absolute and relative computation errors for the following problems:

y' = y, y(0) = 0, x in [0, 5]

and

y' = -y, y(0) = 1, x in [0, 5]
